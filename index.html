                JavaScript is a programming language that allows us to control what happens in a website. Like many
                other languages it has
                basic things like statements, expressions, operators, types and values. What the heck are those? Well
                those
                are simply some basic categories of objects that allow programming to happen. For example, if we wanted
                to
                do math, we'd need operators like +,-,*,/ in order to tell the browser to perform these behavior.
                JavaScript
                also have loops and conditionals to help us not write repeated code. Let's say we wanted to add 1 to a
                number
                1000 times. Can you imagine typing "number = number + 1" a thousand times? Of course not! Luckily,
                JavaScript,
                like any programming languages, saves us the punishment by using loops so that at the end of the day,
                we're
                writing at most 2 lines! While JavaScript have many nice features, it's truly special in that it's an
                interpreted
                language. What does this mean? Being an interpreted language makes JavaScript runnable in any modern
                browser
                without having to compile. This means if several lines of code were added, it would only take refresh
                the
                browser to see the changes immediately!

                DOM, also known as Document Object Model, is an object created by the browser to represent the html
                it's currently displaying.
                It allows javascript to manipulate the html it represents in order to interact with it. Now what does
                this
                mean? It means that in order for javascript to actually do anything in a website, the browser needs to
                build
                something that it can touch. Imagine creating a blueprint on a construction site. Everything is written
                on
                paper (HTML). If a interior designer (javascript) comes along and decides that they wanted to change
                certain
                things like the color of the wall or have the furniture be placed a certain way, it would be somewhat
                difficult
                for them to do. Now along comes a construction company or a modeling company (browser). They would
                create
                a 3D model of the blueprint's specifications or outright build the property. Now the designer can do
                it's
                work to interact with the infrastructure.

                A javascript function is a subprogram that allows a certain task to be performed out of order. It's a
                saved set of instructions
                that can be reused later on to accomplish a task. To put it into an analogy, functions are like your
                browser
                bookmark or your TV channel shortcut on the remote or that saved default pizza order you had on
                Dominoes.com.
                To use a function is to 'Invoke' a function and sometimes functions take in things like arguments. No,
                it's
                not your pointless bickering with your best friend argument. It's input given to the function in order
                to
                determine what it gives back. And giving back is what it does, javascript functions always return
                something
                even when nothing is specified. Functions are also Objects. Objects are like the grand daddy of
                functions.
                Every function are classified as objects as well. Why is this important? Because in javascript,
                functions
                arguments can be objects. This means that a function itself can be passed as an argument to another
                function!

                Best practices are like having a great routine. Once you get it down, things are just smooth and easy
                in life. As such, coding in JavaScript should not be an exception. With the bazillion frameworks out
                there for this amazing language, it's hard keep track of things in your IDE battlefield. But luckily,
                there are established conventions to help us from people who've already bit the bullet (no pun
                intended).

                Avoiding globals - Global variables are like a big red flag that everyone in your code can see. Sure
                there's no avoiding globals completely, but it's a good idea to not have more than you need since they
                can easily be changed by accident.

                Stick to a strict coding style - What's an army without discipline? Yes, modern browsers will babysit
                the code by sanitizing your code before compiling but that may not always be the case. Not declaring
                var, const or let for your variables is like mislabeling your armory arsenal. You don't want to bring a
                knife (let) to a gun (const) fight do you?

                Commenting as much as needed - The power of commenting is highly underestimated. Not only does it helps
                other people read your code, it helps YOU read your code. After all, nobody wants to spend hours
