                JavaScript is a programming language that allows us to control what happens in a website. Like many
                other languages it has
                basic things like statements, expressions, operators, types and values. What the heck are those? Well
                those
                are simply some basic categories of objects that allow programming to happen. For example, if we wanted
                to
                do math, we'd need operators like +,-,*,/ in order to tell the browser to perform these behavior.
                JavaScript
                also have loops and conditionals to help us not write repeated code. Let's say we wanted to add 1 to a
                number
                1000 times. Can you imagine typing "number = number + 1" a thousand times? Of course not! Luckily,
                JavaScript,
                like any programming languages, saves us the punishment by using loops so that at the end of the day,
                we're
                writing at most 2 lines! While JavaScript have many nice features, it's truly special in that it's an
                interpreted
                language. What does this mean? Being an interpreted language makes JavaScript runnable in any modern
                browser
                without having to compile. This means if several lines of code were added, it would only take refresh
                the
                browser to see the changes immediately!

                DOM, also known as Document Object Model, is an object created by the browser to represent the html
                it's currently displaying.
                It allows javascript to manipulate the html it represents in order to interact with it. Now what does
                this
                mean? It means that in order for javascript to actually do anything in a website, the browser needs to
                build
                something that it can touch. Imagine creating a blueprint on a construction site. Everything is written
                on
                paper (HTML). If a interior designer (javascript) comes along and decides that they wanted to change
                certain
                things like the color of the wall or have the furniture be placed a certain way, it would be somewhat
                difficult
                for them to do. Now along comes a construction company or a modeling company (browser). They would
                create
                a 3D model of the blueprint's specifications or outright build the property. Now the designer can do
                it's
                work to interact with the infrastructure.

                A javascript function is a subprogram that allows a certain task to be performed out of order. It's a
                saved set of instructions
                that can be reused later on to accomplish a task. To put it into an analogy, functions are like your
                browser
                bookmark or your TV channel shortcut on the remote or that saved default pizza order you had on
                Dominoes.com.
                To use a function is to 'Invoke' a function and sometimes functions take in things like arguments. No,
                it's
                not your pointless bickering with your best friend argument. It's input given to the function in order
                to
                determine what it gives back. And giving back is what it does, javascript functions always return
                something
                even when nothing is specified. Functions are also Objects. Objects are like the grand daddy of
                functions.
                Every function are classified as objects as well. Why is this important? Because in javascript,
                functions
                arguments can be objects. This means that a function itself can be passed as an argument to another
                function!

                Best practices are like having a great routine. Once you get it down, things are just smooth and easy
                in life. As such, coding in JavaScript should not be an exception. With the bazillion frameworks out
                there for this amazing language, it's hard keep track of things in your IDE battlefield. But luckily,
                there are established conventions to help us from people who've already bit the bullet (no pun
                intended).

                Avoiding globals - Global variables are like a big red flag that everyone in your code can see. Sure
                there's no avoiding globals completely, but it's a good idea to not have more than you need since they
                can easily be changed by accident.

                Stick to a strict coding style - What's an army without discipline? Yes, modern browsers will babysit
                the code by sanitizing your code before compiling but that may not always be the case. Not declaring
                var, const or let for your variables is like mislabeling your armory arsenal. You don't want to bring a
                knife (let) to a gun (const) fight do you?

                Commenting as much as needed - The power of commenting is highly underestimated. Not only does it helps
                other people read your code, it helps YOU read your code. After all, nobody wants to spend hours

                While JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the modern world today, its
                dependency
                on having a browser run its code limits it's potential to becoming a general purpose language. What if
                there is a way to run JavaScript without firing Chrome or Firefox or any browser for that matter? Enter
                Node.js. As a brain child of Ryan Dahl, Node was made using the original V8 engine from Chrome that
                enables
                it to run JavaScript.
                In order to create a run time environment separated from the browser, Node was rewritten using C++
                while
                improving it's efficiency and speed. Several features of Node is Non-Blocking I/O, package management
                using
                NPM and Event Driven. Non-blocking means essentially that users that interact with an application built
                on
                Node is not limited to singular interactions or requests that traditionally freezes the application
                until a
                response is returned. This allows multiple things to happen in the background imitating the concurrency
                of
                languages like Java and Python. A common concern for previous JavaScript frameworks and code is the
                limitation of the global namespace. Node addresses this concern by introducing modules. Modules are the
                standalone libraries of the JavaScript world. Modules prevents code from being overwritten due to
                multiple
                frameworks accidentally using the same namespace.

                When it comes to persisting data, there's usually two ways to go about it, NoSql databases or
                traditional Relational databases. So what's the difference between the two and which one should I use?
                Well depending on the application or purpose, each of these two types of databases have their own
                advantages. Let's start with an relational database. It's the main stay for the major of companies and
                big applications. For many years it's the go to database to manage data and still is. Relational
                databases contains tables and columns just like your typical excel sheet and each of these tables have
                characteristics such as primary keys to uniquely identify a record or row. What is special about
                relational databases is that it holds 'relations' to other tables. Just like its namesake, it defines a
                relationship between two tables by specifying a constraint or a rule using their primary keys. This
                allows users to utilize SQL queries -- the main method of interacting with a relational database, to
                its greatest potential. By having a relationship between tables, it conveys real world meaning to the
                data in the table as an object that have rippling effect to other objects in the world or table.
                It gives the user the ability to quickly filter or group data in one table with another to derive some
                sort of valuable business intelligence or meaning. The downside to this is the overhead and the strict
                formatting one must follow to fully take advantage of the relational schema. It's like setting up a
                mold for your data that must be followed and at times can be inflexible.

                NoSql databases on the other hand is exactly how it sounds. It does not utilize the SQL language to
                interact with its contents. Instead it stores it's data in a very horizontal fashion relative to it's
                relational cousin. NoSql databases do not have a strict mold or rules that govern it's data. It groups
                its a set hierarchy of database, collections, documents and the content in the object. Users do not
                have to worry about having the same number of columns or ensure the data have duplicate keys. The data
                comes in the form of JSON and is stored in the documents which in turn is put under a collection. To
                establish a comparative view, a collection would be a table and document would be a record. While both
                types of databases have some resemblance in structure, NoSql databases offer a unique method of
                interacting with it's data.
