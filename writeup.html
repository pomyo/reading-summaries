                    JavaScript is a programming language that allows us to control what happens in a website.
    
                    Like many other languages it has basic things like statements, expressions, operators, types and values.
                    
                    What the heck are those? Well those are simply some basic categories of objects that allow programming to happen.
                    
                    For example, if we wanted to do math, we'd need operators like +,-,*,/ in order to tell the browser to perform these behavior.
                    
                    JavaScript also have loops and conditionals to help us not write repeated code. Let's say we wanted to add 1 to a number 1000 times.
                    
                    Can you imagine typing "number = number + 1" a thousand times? Of course not! Luckily, JavaScript, like any programming languages, 
                    
                    saves us the punishment by using loops so that at the end of the day, we're writing at most 2 lines!
                    
                    While JavaScript have many nice features, it's truly special in that it's an interpreted language. What does this mean? 
                    
                    Being an interpreted language makes JavaScript runnable in any modern browser without having to compile. This means if several lines 
                    
                    of code were added, it would only take refresh the browser to see the changes immediately!

                    DOM, also known as Document Object Model, is an object created by the browser to represent the html it's currently displaying. 
                    
                    It allows javascript to manipulate the html it represents in order to interact with it. Now what does this mean? 
                    
                    It means that in order for javascript to actually do anything in a website, the browser needs to build something that it can touch.
                    
                    Imagine creating a blueprint on a construction site. Everything is written on paper (HTML). 
                    
                    If a interior designer (javascript) comes along and decides that they wanted to change certain things like the color of the wall or 
                    
                    have the furniture be placed a certain way, it would be somewhat difficult for them to do. Now along comes a construction company or 
                    
                    a modeling company (browser). They would create a 3D model of the blueprint's specifications or outright build the property. 
                    
                    Now the designer can do it's work to interact with the infrastructure.
